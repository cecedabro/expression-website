# expression-website
This is my ongoing project of a website where I post all my art and forms of expression on. It also serves as a nice way to learn web development along the way!

[26/05/2025] 
- Added shark poem on the home page

[28/05/2025] 
- Added navigationbar, added "about", "poems", and "gallery" page. 
- Added image of shark on home page

[29/05/2025]
- Added navigation list on the gallery page, 
- added the apple and silent life paintings. 
- Sorted each page in seperate folders, with seperate style.css scripts

[05/06/2025] 
- Refined the gallery page a bit, refined the apple page and added another picture. 
- Added more into the gallery list. (Still need to create seperate pages for each listed entry.)

[17/06/2025] 
- Added and completed the rest of the gallery pages. Not completely done with the 
page about "abstract shapes of expression". All other pages are fully filled out with 
images and descriptions! 
- finished the shapes of expression page. 
- Fixed a bug with the gallery page. 
- Changed all "pre" text format of the gallary pages into "p" text format for better 
readability and adaptability. 
- Changed the image width to the according screen width, and also
added extra code in the gallery-style.css to change the text-box parameters if the screen
is too small, to increase readability on mobile devices. 

[18/06/2025] 
- Made a seperate navigationbar script, the script is html and each page get the navbar by calling on a javascript file. This way I can edit the navigationbar from one central 
script instead of going to each seperate html page file. 
- Major debuggin with the navbar. 
- Changed the whole folder structure so the overlap between locally hosted site (for developing) matches rougly with github hosted server for consistency in fetch and paths.
