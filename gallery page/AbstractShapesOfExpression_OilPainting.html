    <h1>Abstract shapes of expression - oil painting</h1>

      <p>Alright this will be a deep dive into my inner emotional landscape... </p>
      <p>This was the first oil painting I made after I broke up with my ex. Since she
      had been the one who put me on this whole journey in the first place (I made the
      apple painting at her place with her guidance), it felt very very scary to pick
      up the brush and paint again for myself, wihout her. </p>
      <p>The idea of her was so deeply intertwined with painting that it just felt too scary 
      to start. It took me six months before I had the courage to continue my painting journey,
      essentially to reclaim souvereignty over my artistic expression, free from her. </p>
      <p>I first painted the green shapes, later adding the cyan ones. I built on what
      I had made the previous sessions without a real plan or goal in mind. It just felt
      cool to make such an abstract image of those shapes, and also to connect them. I 
      think it isnt even supposed to "work". I think those cyan shapes at the top right
      dont make any sense, but to be honest that makes it even cooler in my eyes.</p>
      <p>After making those few shapes I kinda forgot about painting again for quite some time
      and didnt bother continuing. 
      Until I got reminded of my past again...</p>
      <p>About eight months later after I had made those cyan and green shapes, I got caught in
      old patterns. Old wounds of attachment essentially. My tumultuous past with my
      ex left scars I had forgotten â€” until falling in love reminded me they still hurt. </p>
      <p>I was caught in emotional storms flipping back and forth, all the while 
      being drained by it and not knowing what was the "right" approach. 
      The right approach for my feelings and how to "heal" as effecient as possible.</p>
      <p>Eventually it got too much for me and I decided to distance myself from the things
      triggering my old patterns. It took me quite some time to get over because I didnt 
      expect that I still had attachment wounds so deep. It felt like such a harsh mirror
      and reality check in a way. </p>
      <p>And after months of distance, I got reminded of it again on a random day - I saw her. 
      That struck me so hard, again. Again I felt powerless and broken. "When will this not affect
      me anymore? Am I doing something wrong?". I decided to try and imagine that feeling 
      as an abstract shape. By this time I had already started with journaling so my emotional
      literacy was improving. </p>
      <p>I imagined those feelings as a dark purple violet cylinder with dark shadows cast 
      over it. So thats what I tried to paint that evening. A dark purple cylinder. </p>
      <p>When I was done with the shape, and during the whole process of painting it, I felt
      such a wave of relief. And a tide of clarity swept over me. Had I just unlocked 
      creative expression? Is this what it means to "feel like a cube"? </p>
      <p>It is a massively brutal purple obelisk just standing there. But it too deserves
      love and recognition, just like all the other parts of my inner mind 
      and myself. By painting that feeling, by giving it space on the canvas 
      I had accepted a part of me. And through that self acceptance and 
      recognition of the obelisk standing there without apologies, 
      I had finally found the inner peace and clarity I sought all that time. </p>
