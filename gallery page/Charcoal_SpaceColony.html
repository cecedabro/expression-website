    <h1>A charcoal drawing perspective exercise! - With a bit of added imagination</h1>

      <p>This was an exercise to practice perspective.</p>
      <p>The teacher had arranged a couple of items, each with unique but recognisable shapes.</p>
      <p>It was mainly meant to practice with perspective lines, as you might be able to tell from the slightly blurred lines.</p>
    </div>
    <img src="artworks/charcoal_1.2.jpeg" alt="charcoal_1.2" width="800">
    <div class="text-box">
      <p>After drawing the shapes I let my imagination run wild and decided to turn it into a martian colony!</p>
      <p>You can see a planet  (or moon) get destroyed above the horizon!</p>
      <p>(I also turned it into something else to have fun with a girl at that writing course)</p>
