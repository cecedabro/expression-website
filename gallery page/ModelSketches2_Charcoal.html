    <h1>Real life model rapid charcoal sketches! - only 10 minutes per drawing [second model session]</h1>

        <p>This was the second time we did real life model sketching, again with charcoal!</p>
        <p>This time I took a completely different approach though, I guess in art there's only 
            happy accidents.</p>
        <p>To give some context, I was in the middle of a semester plagued by linear 
            algebra and I had been studying the whole day about vectors. Vectors with 
            a direction and length, even three dimensional vectors were still floating 
            around in my mind.</p>
        <p>I came late to drawing class so I got a short explanation of the exercise 
            from the teacher, he told me that today we would focus on the shape and 
            direction of forms â€” at least that's how I remember it. In my vectorised mind, 
            I imagined vectors for every point on the model's skin, each with its own 
            length and direction. Sort of assembling into a grid of information about 
            direction and curvature. That's what I tried to create.</p>
        <p>I didn't make an outline, nor draw any shapes. I moved my charcoal along 
            the curvature of the shape I tried to recreate. It forced me to watch 
            attentively to the different limbs of the model, and take into consideration 
            how each limb was curved and how body parts flow into each other.</p>
        <p>Great exercise!</p>

        <p>Here's the second sketch from the same model, this time in another pose.</p>
        <p>The little sketch on the top left was made by the teacher. He wanted to show 
            how you can divide the model's body into basic shapes. So I tried to 
            incorporate that into my drawing!</p>
        <p>You can see the old line running from his calves to his knee. 
            This was the bottom line of a triangle, just like in the small sketch.</p>
        <p>I think what works is the shading and the lack of detail. Here 
            I did draw a small outline because I wanted to try the teacher's 
            approach of using small shapes to build the model. I filled it in 
            with my same vectorised approach though, only drawing in the curvature 
            of each body part!</p>
        <p>I also like how the face has no detail. It was a deliberate choice since 
            I had no idea how I wanted to draw a face, but I think it works pretty 
            good this way. Makes it feel more raw and artsy.</p>

        <p>This was the final sketch, here he sat on a stool. Interesting to draw!</p>
        <p>I went back to my original way of drawing, no outlines nor shapes. 
            I remember starting with his leg and building his body along the way. 
            I'm not sure if I drew the stools before or after the model... I think after.</p>
        <p>The sharp invisible outlines were made by using an eraser to cut off the 
            charcoal. What I struggled with was keeping the body parts separate, 
            like the arm and his core, his hand and his leg (yeah it's hard to see). 
            If I had more time I could have refined it further, but that's the creative 
            limit of this exercise!</p>
        <p>Still, I'm very glad with how it turned out though. I thought it would be 
            a cool touch to draw the stools in a completely different style. Bold 
            outlines, no inner texture. I thought that could represent the difference 
            between life and lifeless. Essentially we see black flames bursting with 
            life, contrasted by the hollow shape of lifeless items.</p>
        <p>(Could be a Dark Souls reference to the Pygmy Soul haha)</p>
