    <h1>Real life model rapid charcoal sketches! - only 10 minutes per drawing [first model session]</h1>

      <p>This was the first time I ever did real life model sketches!</p>
      <p>The medium was charcoal and we had 10 minutes per "pose".</p>
      <p>Something to notice are the lines and proportions. The teacher had taught us a few quick things about basic proportions. A ground rule was "height of the body equals five times the head."</p>
      <p>Another thing to notice is how some lines are tilted and others are straight. This was meant to guide the drawing process and help with drawing realistic posture.</p>

      <p>Here's another sketch from the same model. I tried to make his fingers curl around the box he sat on, but I only had time to do it with his right hand.</p>
      <p>I struggled maintaining good perspective with the model and box. Overall still glad how it turned out!</p>
      <p>I think what works in both sketches is the bold black outline. I didnâ€™t give it texture [I think that was also what the teacher asked for] but it makes the lines strike out even more.</p>
      <p>Only filling in the hair gives it nice contrast with the rest of his body too!</p>
