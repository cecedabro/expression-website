      <p>This was my first ever oil painting!</p>
      <p>I learnt a very important lesson with this one...</p>
      <p>When it's finished, it's finished! Don't overcomplicate what's done.</p>
      <p>Here is the painting how it looked after I kept working on it even though it was basically done...</p>
      <p>I kept adding more and more. I thought that by blending the colours, adding texture that it would turn out "better".</p>
      <p>But to be honest I think the piece was finished when it looked like the previous image.</p>
