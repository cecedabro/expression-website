        <p>This was a small silent life I made as birthdaypresent for my French grandparents!</p>
        <p>Something I struggled with was the shadows and perspective. 
            I didn't really think about where my light source was coming from 
            and kinda just "improvised" shadows. </p>
        <p> I'm happy with the way it turned out though! It's a great exercise 
            for colour mixing, shading and abstract shapes understanding. </p>
