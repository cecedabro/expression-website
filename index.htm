  <h1>Welcome to My Art Site! (test4)</h1>
  <p>This project is a work in progress. Here is my first poem:</p>

  <pre>
I stride and swim along the currents of blue,
The oceanic depth gliding cold through my gills,
Tidal echoes submerge my ears,
I stray adrift, in the deep tranquillity of peace.

A school of silvery stars meets my gaze,
Fast, darting, slippery stars
Their place and pace aligned with flows of the deep,

Everything here is in harmony, the harmony, I am

Rays of azure graze my scars,
Stories of far engrained in my flesh,
I sense my nose tingling, a scent so fresh and bold
My universe begins to narrow, eyes turning cold
It smells good, really good
I yearn it, I need it
blood.

Devoured by hunger I chase that delicious smell,
My body and mind converged, to a sharp thirst. 
The burgundy trail rushing past my gills,
Propelled by lust I slice the deep,
I spread my jaws. - He’s all alone.

I rip, he tears,
I crush, he cracks,
Disembowel and engorge,
Torn to shreds, devoured whole

As the crimson cloud dissolves in the deep,
I remain weightless, in the abyss

Drifting on, fulfilled and calm
I’m plunged in a rain of stars,
Veiled in their light, I embody the serene 
Satisfied with my nature at peace,
I harbour harmony
I am complete
