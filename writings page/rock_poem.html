        <p>Poem from the perspective of a certain thing… A thing which doesn’t feel 
            the need to express itself or its thoughts. Yet, it still adds to the 
            texture of the universe and experiences reality
            through its own lens, a hard, cold, grey, and uniquely beautiful lens…</p>

    I see as I rest, a worlds sight below my gaze<br>
    Towering in height from rocks of old,<br>
    Solar rays graze my skin, dry and cold.<br><br>

    The sun my warmth, the clouds my shade,<br>
    The rain my skin, I breathe the breeze.<br><br>

    I’m not covered in grass nor green,<br>
    For there’s only rock – just grey like me.<br><br>

    I witness seasons cycle<br>
    I remain unmoved.<br>
    Until something cracks,<br>
    Crumbles,<br>
    I do move<br><br>

    I tumble and roll,<br>
    Descend without control,<br>
    Crashing down, cascading forth,<br>
    Thundering clacks of rock shattering old.<br>
    Crumbling over vast stretches of stone,<br>
    I cross creeks, rivers, flowing clear and bold.<br><br>

    Unbothered I clatter on<br>
    Until I’m caught<br>
    I plummet,<br>
    in the freshly cold.<br><br>

    Trashed around, propelled forth,<br>
    Scattering astray under flowing force.<br><br>

    Colliding currents, jets dashing blue,<br>
    Crumbling corrosion at my pores,<br>
    Shedding sheathes of rock,<br>
    I erode to my core.<br><br>

    There I’m left - until I am all that is left.<br>
    Leaving a trace of light,<br>
    My core trembles vividly,<br>
    Shivering a solar white.<br><br>

    Crystalline, pristinely I shimmer.<br>
    Beneath a blanket of aquatic foam and glimmer,<br>
    I lay shiny, in a bed of sand.<br><br>

    Those being grains from ventures past.<br>
