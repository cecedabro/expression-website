    <h1>Welcome to the shark poem!</h1>

  <div class="poem">
    I stride and swim along the currents of blue,<br>
    The oceanic depth gliding cold through my gills,<br>
    Tidal echoes submerge my ears,<br>
    I stray adrift, in the deep tranquillity of peace.<br><br>

    A school of silvery stars meets my gaze,<br>
    Fast, darting, slippery stars<br>
    Their place and pace aligned with flows of the deep,<br><br>

    Everything here is in harmony, the harmony, I am<br><br>

    Rays of azure graze my scars,<br>
    Stories of far engrained in my flesh,<br>
    I sense my nose tingling, a scent so fresh and bold<br>
    My universe begins to narrow, eyes turning cold<br>
    It smells good, really good<br>
    I yearn it, I need it<br>
    blood.<br><br>

    Devoured by hunger I chase that delicious smell,<br>
    My body and mind converged, to a sharp thirst.<br>
    The burgundy trail rushing past my gills,<br>
    Propelled by lust I slice the deep,<br>
    I spread my jaws. - He’s all alone.<br><br>

    I rip, he tears,<br>
    I crush, he cracks,<br>
    Disembowel and engorge,<br>
    Torn to shreds, devoured whole<br><br>

    As the crimson cloud dissolves in the deep,<br>
    I remain weightless, in the abyss<br><br>

    Drifting on, fulfilled and calm<br>
    I’m plunged in a rain of stars,<br>
    Veiled in their light, I embody the serene<br>
    Satisfied with my nature at peace,<br>
    I harbour harmony<br>
    I am complete<br>
