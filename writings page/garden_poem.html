    Below the blazing august sun,<br>
    The kid watched in awe<br>
    His father tended this garden,<br>
    A garden filled with green and joy,<br>
    Brushed by the winds of change<br><br>

    The fathers’ hands blistered from weeds removed<br>
    The kid apologised to those weeds,<br>
    Don’t they deserve a place in this garden too?<br><br>

    Tears of sweat dripping down his chin<br>
    Dirt in his pores, sweat, salty skin<br>
    His blisters burned under the august sun,<br>
    The kid watched and wondered,<br>
    How his father always pressed on<br><br>

    Berry filled bushes, bees buzzing by<br>
    Fields full flowers, blossom blooming sweet<br>
    A harmonious creation from bugs and plants,<br>
    They all lived in the garden,<br>
    A garden the father had made<br><br>

    Past the dancing wildflowers and singing bugs,<br>
    Across fields cheering blissful life,<br>
    The garden had been left untended<br><br>

    As the kid and his father crossed dry barren paths,<br>
    The kid saw old roots wrangling the garden trail,<br>
    Weeds had taken over, their domain a green dark<br>
    Thorns filled empty bushes, dried brown and sharp<br><br>

    Here the fathers’ skin didn’t burn under solar heat,<br>
    For its light was swallowed, by the invasively green<br><br>

    Having traversed this domain of dark,<br>
    They reached a plain of grass,<br>
    There lied a tree stump, a woman’s old,<br>
    Winds of loss cried the fathers sweat cold<br><br>

    The once motherly shadow of the tree still covering his eyes,<br>
    Looming tears of sweat, rolling over his cheek<br>
    The father quietly apologised<br><br>

    The kid didn’t know what his father had done,<br>
    He didn’t have to know yet, he wouldn’t understand<br>
    The rusty axe still there, it had been an act of love<br><br>

    But the kid quietly wondered<br><br>

    When will mommy come back?<br>
